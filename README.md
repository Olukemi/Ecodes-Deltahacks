# Ecodes-Deltahacks

Ecodes rewards you for every sustainable decision you make. Some examples are: shopping at sustainable partner businesses, taking the local transit, and eating at sustainable restaurants. Simply scanning an Ecode at these locations will allow you to claim EcoPoints that can be converted into discounts, coupons or gift cards to eco-conscious businesses. Ecodes also sends users text-based reminders when acting sustainably is especially convenient (ex. take the bus when the weather is unsafe for driving). Furthermore, sustainable businesses also get free advertising, so it's a win-win for both parties!
