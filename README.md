# Ecodes-Deltahacks

This app is a modern way to embed an eco-friendly lifestyle into people to take care of our environment. A lot of the time, we need motivation to do whatâ€™s right and so we developed an app that improves our human lifestyle by being rewarded with every eco-friendly action we take. There are very small but impactful ways to save the plant like, using reusable bags, shopping at thrift stores, or taking bus/carpooling and each time someone does so this app will reward them! Simply scanning a QR code at every location where you can be environmentally friendly will enable you to claim points that can be converted into discounts, coupons or gift cards to small businesses!
